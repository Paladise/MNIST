# Full MNIST Walkthrough

This Jupyter Notebook was created to address this challenge in the `Further Research` section of [**Chapter 4**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/04_mnist_basics.ipynb) in fast ai's textbook:
> Complete all the steps in this chapter using the full MNIST datasets (that is, for all digits, not just 3s and 7s). This is a significant project and will take you quite a bit of time to complete! You'll need to do some of your own research to figure out how to overcome some obstacles you'll meet on the way.

Hope this helps anyone looking to complete this as well :)
